# Golfstats

A simple Grape API and a javascript frontend to show off some of my golfstats.

## Installation

* `git clone` this repository
* `bundle install`

## Running

* `rackup config.ru`
* Visit your app at http://localhost:9292.


TODO:
* Filter by last 5,10,20,30, course, month
* Compare filter agains another filter
* Show first9 vs last9
* Delete json cache (and maybe repopulate) for that year + all when new scorecard(s) are imported
*

* add config for running on heroku, for super-easy deploy and play, then move to fransman.se
